## Hey!

I'm Ian, a Full-Stack Software Engineer based in the UK.

I graduated from the University of Sheffield with a 1st Class Honours in Software Engineering, and I'm currently working at The Curve Consulting delivering bespoke software solutions for clients across various sectors.

When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring machine learning projects, playing music, or diving into sports analytics.

Feel free to explore the site and get in touch!
